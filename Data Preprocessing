1. Data Preprocessing
Overview
Dataset Selection: For this example, we use a publicly available dataset such as the CoNLL-2003 NER dataset or one provided via SpaCy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
• Load the dataset and inspect sample sentences and entity labels.
• Check for class imbalances and overall statistics (number of tokens, entities per sentence, etc.).
Preprocessing Steps:
• Lowercase the text and remove stopwords using libraries like NLTK or SpaCy.
• Perform lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
• Tokenize the text and align tokens with the entity labels.
Formatting:
• Convert your data into a format expected by your chosen NLP framework. For example, if using SpaCy, format the training examples as tuples of text and annotations.
Sample Code Snippet
python
Copy
Edit
import spacy
from spacy.tokens import DocBin
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

# Ensure NLTK data is downloaded (run once)
nltk.download('stopwords')
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

# Load your dataset (assuming a structured format like JSON or CSV)
# Example: preprocess each sentence
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Lowercase the text
    text = text.lower()
    # Tokenize (you can also use SpaCy's tokenizer)
    tokens = text.split()
    # Remove stopwords
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]
    return " ".join(tokens)

# Example usage with a sample sentence:
sample_text = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion."
preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(sample_text)
print(preprocessed_text)
