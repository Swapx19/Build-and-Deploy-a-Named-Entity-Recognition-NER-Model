Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for building, training, and deploying a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model. The key components include:

Data Preprocessing:
Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and entity tagging are performed on the dataset (e.g., CoNLL-2003 or SpaCy’s NER dataset) to prepare the data for training.

Model Training & Evaluation:
A custom NER model is trained using SpaCy’s framework. The training process includes data splitting, iterative learning with model updates, and evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and entity-level accuracy.

Model Deployment:
The trained model is deployed as a REST API using FastAPI. The API includes a /predict endpoint that accepts text input and returns recognized entities along with their labels and positions.

Containerization & Documentation:
The project is containerized using Docker to ensure consistent deployment. Comprehensive documentation and code comments are provided for easy setup and further development.

This repository serves as a complete demonstration of integrating NLP techniques with modern API development and containerization, making it suitable for real-world applications and interview assessments.

Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ner-api-project.git
cd ner-api-project
Create a Virtual Environment:

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Ensure that packages like spacy, fastapi, uvicorn, nltk, and others are specified in the requirements.txt.

Download Additional Data (if needed):

For example, if using NLTK for stopword removal, download the necessary datasets:

python
Copy
Edit
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"
Similarly, if your model requires SpaCy language models (e.g., en_core_web_sm), install them as follows:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Train the NER Model:

Run your training script (e.g., train.py) to preprocess the dataset, train the model, and save it to disk:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
This script should output a serialized model (for example, in a folder named ner_model).

Usage Guide
Running the API Locally:

Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn app:app --reload
The API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Testing the API Endpoint:

The /predict endpoint accepts a POST request with JSON input. For example, using curl:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion."}' \
     -H "token: secret-token"
The API will return a JSON response with the recognized entities, including the entity text, label, and character positions.

API Authentication:

Basic authentication is implemented. Make sure to pass the required token in your requests. In this example, the token is set to "secret-token". Adjust this in the authentication dependency function as needed.

Containerization with Docker:

To build and run the Docker container:

Build the Docker Image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t ner-api-project .
Run the Docker Container:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 80:80 ner-api-project
The API will now be available on the host machine on port 80.

Further Enhancements:

Logging & Error Handling:
Enhance the API by integrating logging (using Python’s logging module) and more robust error handling.

Deployment:
Optionally, deploy your containerized API to cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
